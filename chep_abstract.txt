Lobster - An Opportunistic Computing Framework
==============================================

Analyses within CMS require extensive use of computing resources to produce
results.  Most of these computing resources are found at dedicated CMS
computing facilities, which users connect to or use via grid submission.
Since these resources are shared, the progress of any analysis depends
highly on the overall analysis activity at CMS.
A part of these facilities are at universities, where the IT department
will often outfit a part of their available machines with CMS a specific
software setup, to be primarily used by the local CMS group.  This allows
for a highly responsive analysis workflow, that is limited by the number of
CPUs available.

At the University of Notre Dame, additional resources on currently idle
machines owned by other working groups are provided for general usage, but
any running jobs can be terminated at the owners will.
In cooperation with the local Cooperative Computing Lab,
we have developed an opportunistic workflow management tool, Lobster,
to harvest these idle CPUs while mitigating the effects of job eviction.
A client-server design based on work_queue is used to run user analyses,
where the CMS specific software environment for the jobs is provided via
CVMFS in a parrot sandbox.  Data access is performed through chirp for local
data and xrootd for CMS data.  We will evaluate the design and performance
of our approach using our workgroup's analysis workflow.
